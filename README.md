# Fast IP ðŸš€ | IP infos, nothing else.

## What about it?

I had trouble to find a website that just shows me my IP infos.
All i wanted to have was my IP Address and some basic informations like localisation, server...
Websites about IP Addresses are full of advertising, products to sell and other functionnality that i did not need.
